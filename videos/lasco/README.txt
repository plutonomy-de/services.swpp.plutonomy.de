Lasco Coronagraph -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Large Angle and Spectrometric COronagraph (LASCO) instrument is one of 11 instruments 
included on the joint NASA/ESA SOHO (Solar and Heliospheric Observatory) spacecraft. SOHO was 
launched on 2 December 1995 at 0808 UT (0308 EST) from the Kennedy Space Center, Cape 
Canaveral, Florida. The LASCO instrument is a set of three coronagraphs that image the solar 
corona from 1.1 to 32 solar radii. It is convenient to measure distances in terms of solar 
radii. One solar radius is about 700,000 km, 420,000 miles or 16 arc minutes. 

A coronagraph is a telescope that is designed to block light coming from the solar disk, in 
order to see the extremely faint emission from the region around the sun, called the corona.
