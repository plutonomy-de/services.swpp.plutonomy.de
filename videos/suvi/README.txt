GOES Solar Ultraviolet Imager (SUVI) ----------------------------------------------------------

The SUVI telescopes are mounted on the Sun-pointing solar array gimbals of the GOES weather 
satellites. These satellites are in geosynchronous orbits that allow continuous solar viewing, 
24 hours/day, 7 days/week. The only exception to this is around equinox dates when the GOES 
satellites enter Earth's shadow for up to one hour each day.

Each SUVI collects a solar EUV image several times per minute, and the exposure settings follow
a sequence that is optimized to observe three primary phenomena as they are reflected in the 
Solar atmosphere: coronal structures, active regions, and solar flares.

SWPC presents the images and animations of the GOES SUVI instruments in near-real-time, and 
uses them in analyzing events and in issuing space weather watches, warnings, and alerts.
